# Shellkit

This repo contains all of my default dotfile cofigurations for different apps/shells. Configuration includes:

- `.zshrc`
- `.tmux.config`
- `oh-my-zsh` and it's related plugins
- `p10k` config

The root directory contains an automated install script `install.sh` to install the related software.
## Windows
Drop the contents of the windows folder into `OneDrive/<user>/Documents/WindowsPowershell`. There are some permissions errors to squash out about the installs, but nothing serious. LLM's have a solid handle on that. Set the files to always be downloaded on your machine in OneDrive.
