# Dotfiles

This repo contains all of my default dotfile cofigurations for different apps/shells. Configuration includes:

- `.zshrc`
- `.tmux.config`
- `oh-my-zsh` and it's related plugins
- `p10k` config

The root directory contains an automated install script `install.sh` to install the related software.
